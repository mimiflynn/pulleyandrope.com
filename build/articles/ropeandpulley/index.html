<p>I purchased this domain name on a whim, with no prior googling to see if the url had a meme attached to it. I bought my server space also on a whim, so, here we are, on the internet, you and me, interacting in a way previously unplanned.

<p>Today, I spent a small amount of time at with people from <a href="http://braininterfacelab.wordpress.com" title="hack a brain">Brain Interface Labs</a> at the <a href="http://braininterfacelab.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/hack-a-brain/" title="hack a brain">hack a brain</a> event. It was particularly interesting and got me wondering about the theraputic potentials of a brain interface device. Had a hard day? Stare at these pretty lights for a bit with this headset on. Just wait and see what happens.

<p>In other news, I&apos;m attempting to use the fancy cmx.js project to start a comic blog at <a href="http://iwaspromisedcookies.com" title="I was promised cookies">iwaspromisedcookies.com</a> to document the crazy conversations I tend to overhear in New York City. Hopefully, I&apos;ll be able to keep it up ;)

<p>The blog is powered by <a href="http://jnordberg.github.com/wintersmith/" title="wintersmith on github">Wintersmith</a>, btw. It is a static page generator build on nodejs and its amazing and I love it so far.</p>
