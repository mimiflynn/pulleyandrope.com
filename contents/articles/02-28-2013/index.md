My father is a retired electrical engineer. He spent his career engineering the electrical systems of fighter jets. Throughout my entire childhood, my father never hired anyone to fix anything around the house; he did it himself. He would tinker and go to the hardware store and ask questions, and made things work. My science projects were always among the best in the class because they tended to have something fun and electrical about them. A presentation about Thomas Edison had a barebones but working lightbulb and battery setup that wowed my teachers. He taught me to enlarge a map of New Zealand with graph paper and and bright light.
