# Interesting Links

This is, essentially, my cited sources, a bibliography of articles that might come up in future conversation. If you heard me say 'I recently read something about that', there is probably a link to it here. Nontheless, I hope you enjoy digging through these links as much I have enjoyed discovering them.
