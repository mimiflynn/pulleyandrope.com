A while ago, I was reading about particularly epic geological minutia, like how an entire tectonic plate had slammed into the northwestern part of the united states and now resides somewhere under the midwest, or how you can see te path te pacific plate had taken across the globe and over the hotspot thst crested the hawaiian islands by tracking the submerged peaks to the northwestern most lf the islands.

so, anyway, i feel that the end of the great salinity crisis millions of years ago should b of note.
