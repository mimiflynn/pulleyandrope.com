#Rope and Pulley

I purchased this domain name on a whim, with no prior googling to see if the url had a meme attached to it. I bought my server space also on a whim, so, here we are, on the internet, you and me, interacting in a way previously unplanned.

Today, I spent a small amount of time at with people from [Brain Interface Labs](http://braininterfacelab.wordpress.com "hack a brain") at the [hack a brain](http://braininterfacelab.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/hack-a-brain/ "hack a brain") event. It was particularly interesting and got me wondering about the theraputic potentials of a brain interface device. Had a hard day? Stare at these pretty lights for a bit with this headset on. Just wait and see what happens.

In other news, I'm attempting to use the fancy cmx.js project to start a comic blog at [iwaspromisedcookies.com](http://iwaspromisedcookies.com "I was promised cookies") to document the crazy conversations I tend to overhear in New York City. Hopefully, I'll be able to keep it up ;)

The blog is powered by [Wintersmith](http://jnordberg.github.com/wintersmith/ "wintersmith on github"), btw. It is a static page generator build on nodejs and its amazing and I love it so far.
